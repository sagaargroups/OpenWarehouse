# Science Plugin

A collection of extensions (e.g. skills) for scientific research tasks, spanning
genomics, structural biology, cheminformatics, scientific literature, and more.

Each extension provides structured instructions, scripts, and resources that
extend Antigravity's capabilities for specialized scientific tasks.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

We use the `uv` package manager to handle dependencies. The first time you
trigger an extension in the Science Plugin, the agent will ask for approval to
install `uv`, and then proceed to respond to your scientific query / task. We
recommend restarting Antigravity after this first time installation.

Some skills, such as AlphaGenome and OpenAlex, require an API key to function.
Others, such as ClinVar, benefit from an API key to unlock higher rate limits
but are still functional without one. The agent should prompt you to obtain the
API key and guide you through writing in the correct location. However, if you
would rather do this yourself, you can run a command like this in your terminal:
`echo "ALPHAGENOME_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key" >> ~/.env`

### Customizing or creating extensions

If you want to customize an existing extension or create a new extension of your
own, you should **not** modify the files inside the Science Plugin installation
directory, as your changes will be overwritten whenever the Science Plugin is
updated. Instead, place your custom or modified extensions elsewhere, e.g.
skills can be placed in your personal skills directory:

```
~/.gemini/config/skills/
```
